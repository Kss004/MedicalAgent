    Calculates a risk awareness score based on questionnaire inputs.
    
    Score Components:
    - symptom_score: +2 for major symptoms (irregular cycles, hirsutism, acne)
    - lifestyle_score: +1 for low energy or high BMI
    - family_history_score: +2 for PCOS/Diabetes family history
    - age_factor: +1 if typical onset age (15-30)
    
    Total Score determines Category:
    - 0-2: LOW (awareness)

    - 6+: HIGH (pattern awareness, consult doctor)
